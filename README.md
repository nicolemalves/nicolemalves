## Hello, I'm Nicole! :wave:

I'm 25 years old. I study Analysis and Systems Development at Est√°cio University. My interest is to dedicate myself to front end development and I study courses and bootcamp to help too. I love technology and its constant evolution, always looking to bring a innovation to the market and trying to make people's lives easier, I want to be a part of it and that's why I am decided that I will dedicate myself to make this happen.

## Still learning... :mortar_board:
